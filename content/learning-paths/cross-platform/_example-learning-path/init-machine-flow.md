## Setup a computer

There are multiple ways to setup a computer for Learning Path creation. 

Only three tools are mandatory:
- A text editor to create and modify markdown files
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator to review content 
- Git to access the repository and submit contributions

## Fork the repository

No matter how you want to work, the first step is to fork the GitHub repository into your own GitHub account. 

Go to the [repository in GitHub](https://github.com/zachlas/arm-software-developers-ads) and click `Fork` in the top right area. Follow the prompts to create a new fork. This provides your own copy for you to make changes without impacting the main repository. 

## Setup a development machine 

Three possible ways to setup a development machine are covered below. 

Select **one** that works for you (or share other ways that work for you).

1. A local computer (Linux, Mac, or Windows)
2. A Gitpod instance with tools pre-installed (easiest)
3. A remote Linux server via SSH (such as AWS EC2)

## 1 Setup a local computer

The first way to work is to install the required tools on your local computer. 

Any text editor can be used to create and modify the project markdown files. Many developers use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but any text editor can be used. 

[Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) using the documentation for your operating system. 

Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine (substitute your github account name in the command below). You can copy the path by visiting your fork in GitHub and clicking the Code button.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account-name>/arm-software-developers-ads
```

Install Hugo so you can see how your changes look before submitting. This enables you to run a local web server and see the content just how it will appear when published. 

The easiest way to download Hugo on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) is using the package manager.

```bash
sudo apt install hugo
```

You can also download and install Hugo from the [releases page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). 

Any recent version of Hugo will work. The **extended version of Hugo is not needed**. Hugo works on all major operating systems and architectures. 

For even more ways to install Hugo [check the documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

Check Hugo is installed correctly and check the version by running this command:

```bash
hugo version
```

## 2 Setup [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) 

Gitpod is a cloud development environment (CDE) which makes it easy to create software from any computer. 

Instead of installing tools on your local computer, you can create and modify content directly in Gitpod. The repository is configured to initialize a Gitpod instance with all tools/software you need to start contributing right away. 

Visit your fork of the GitHub project in your browser. 

Install the [Gitpod Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) which installs a Gitpod button in your GitHub projects. 

If you want to skip the browser extension, you can also prefix the URL for your fork of the GitHub project with gitpod.io/# to open the project in Gitpod.

Either way, open the repository in Gitpod. The URL looks like: https://gitpod.io/#github.com/zachlas/arm-software-developers-ads (replace with the path to your fork).

You can use your GitHub credentials (or another authentication method) to login to Gitpod and use the Free plan which offers 500 credits (about 50 hours) per month. 

## 3 Setup a remote Linux server

A remote Linux server, such as an AWS EC2 instance or other cloud virtual machine, can also be used. 

Start a cloud server and log in using ssh. 

Install the same tools as you would on the local computer setup above: a text editor, git, and Hugo. 

To access the Hugo server on the remote machine, use ssh port forwarding (use port 1313):

```bash
ssh -L 1313:localhost:1313 user@ip-address
```

Clone your fork of the repository to the remote Linux server (substitute your github account name in the command below):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-account-name>/arm-software-developers-ads
```

To use Visual Studio Code in the browser on your remote Linux server check the install information for [OpenVSCode Server](/install-tools/openvscode-server/) and [VS Code Tunnels](/install-tools/vscode-tunnels/)

## Contribution process

Regardless of what type of development machine you are using, with all the prerequisites installed and the fork the repository cloned, you are new ready to start contributing content. 

The content creation process consists of editing the markdown files for the Learning Paths of interest and viewing the changes on your computer using Hugo. 

Run hugo to launch a development version of website on your machine.

```bash
hugo server
```

Hugo server will print a message to connect to port 1313

```console
Web Server is available at //localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
```

Open a browser and go to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313)

Iterate editing markdown files and viewing the results on the local Hugo server.

The next section will cover how to create and format Learning Paths.
