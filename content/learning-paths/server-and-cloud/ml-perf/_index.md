title: Measure Machine Learning Inference Performance on Arm servers

description: Learn how to measure machine learning inference performance on Arm servers

minutes_to_complete: 20

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for software developers interested in benchmarking machine learning workloads on Arm servers.

learning_objectives:
    - Install and run tensorflow on your Arm-based cloud server
    - Use MLPerf Inference benchmark suite, an open-sourced benchmark from MLCommons to test ML performance on your Arm server

prerequisites:
    - An [Arm based instance](/learning-paths/server-and-cloud/csp/) from an appropriate cloud service provider.
